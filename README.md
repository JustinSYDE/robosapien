###Description
A small hack to get an old Robosapien toy to walk autonomously. 
Opened up the Robosapien and hooked up an arduino to the toy.
Used a photoresistor to detect when it's come close to a boundary.
Commands to program the Robosapien to walk, karate chop, etc. were found here: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/RoboSapienIR.
